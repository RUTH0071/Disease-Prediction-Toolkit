# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health data.  
It aims to assist in early diagnosis and decision support for healthcare professionals.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization  
- Multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- User-friendly pipeline for training and prediction

## Dataset
The dataset used is the **Cleveland Heart Disease dataset** from the UCI Repository.  
It contains patient health parameters like age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, etc.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, normalization, encoding categorical features  
2. **EDA** – Statistical analysis and visualization  
3. **Model Training** – Train multiple ML models  
4. **Model Evaluation** – Compare metrics and choose the best model  
5. **Prediction** – Use trained model to predict on new patient data
